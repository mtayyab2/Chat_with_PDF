# Chat_with_PDF
A Chatbot application of RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) that reads and evaluates the text in a PDF file and answers questions regarding that text.

### Tired of reading your whole documents with loads of irrelevant information that you don't need? Or you want to scrape a book for one single thing, but don't want to read the whole book? or You are looking for an understanding of a concept in a different language that you don't speak or understand. Don't Worry! this project has you covered with an additional layer of privacy to run it locally on your pc without the need for internet or a **"PAID API"**. It has the same interface like ChatGPT or other chatbots. You can ask your personal assistant to do analysis of a data you are working on, or make you understand a concept that will take too long to understand via the conventional method. The better your prompts are, the better this assistant will work for you.
